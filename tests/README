This folder has scripts for running simple tests using KPart.

example.sh
==========
The simple script is designed to demonstrate how to invoke KPart. 
It runs multiple copies of a microbenchmark app which traverses an 
array (available under kpart/lltools), then profiles their cache needs 
and partitions the last-level cache among them using KPart.

To execute any other applications and profile them + partition the cache using KPart,
simply replace the process commands in the script with your own.
